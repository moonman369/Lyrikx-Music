                "By the time this debut EP was released, Sam Smith was already a sensation. The British singer-songwriter previously sang on two smash hits (Disclosure’s “Latch” and Naughty Boy’s “La La La”) and won some impressive UK awards including a BRIT Critics’ Choice award and a BBC Sound of 2014 poll. If the burden of expectations was weighing on Smith, it’s hard to tell from this excellent effort. The singer sounds sophisticated and assured, as if Smith feels there’s nothing the project needs to prove. It’s an approach that works. <i>Nirvana</i> features mostly slow, synth-driven grooves like “Safe with Me,” “Together,” and the title track, which highlights Smith's remarkable falsetto and subtle phrasing. There’s also a stripped-down version of “Latch” that reveals an entirely different side to the song. Still, it’s the midtempo “Money on My Mind” that emerges as the catchiest track here, and it shows Smith is more than just an evocative balladeer. Based on the promise of <i>Nirvana</i>, there’s much more to come from this promising young talent.",

                "“This album is how I healed myself,” Sam Smith tells Apple Music. “And it sums up what I went through so perfectly.” Perhaps unsurprising for an artist who has made songs about love and loss their trademark, the singer is referring to heartbreak, which they document in granular detail on their third album <i>Love Goes</i>. There’s relatable post-split hedonism (\"Dance [’Til You Love Someone Else]\"), the crushing low of hearing your ex has moved on (“Another One”), and the slow journey towards self-acceptance (“Love Goes”). But if you’re expecting Smith to only explore such subjects via balladry: don’t. This is an album full of life-affirming pop, as well as disco, acoustic guitars, and cinematic strings. This is, too, an album that the singer made us wait for. Originally titled <i>To Die For</i> and slated for release in early 2020, it was delayed—then reworked—to become <i>Love Goes</i>, as Smith took stock during 2020’s global lockdown. “When everything stopped, it made me realize the album wasn’t finished, in a weird way,” they say. “And that the title felt really inappropriate. There was talk of me not releasing anything at all and just going back to the drawing board. But the last two years for me as a writer and a singer were so beautiful and freeing. And I wanted to share that with people.” The finished product, says Smith, is the record they are most proud of so far—and the album on which they feel the most free. “I felt at one point that I was going to be trapped onstage wearing a suit and singing ballads for the rest of my life,” they say. “When I look back at this album, it reminds me of the courage it took. To this day, there’s a music industry of people that wants me to do a certain thing, to abide by the rules. The risks that I took and the stress that it caused for me to truly be myself and express myself in a queer way was really difficult. I’m proud of myself for doing that.” Read on as Smith candidly walks us through <i>Love Goes</i>.<br />\n<b>Young</b>\n“‘Young’ is really sad. I wrote it with [British producer and songwriter] Steve Mac, and the lyrics were a commentary on fame and the position I’m in. I became well-known when I was 21. After <i>In the Lonely Hour</i>, there was this constant feeling of wanting to be normal and do normal things, and feeling like I can't because of the pressure on me. All I wanted to do was smoke a joint, have a drink, go out, kiss loads of boys and have one-night stands—just be young. And I felt like I had that right taken away from me because when I do it, people are watching and judging me. I wanted to start the album with this song because it was a declaration. But it was also saying, ’This isn't going to be an album of only uptempo pop. I'm still the person who was writing those sad love songs.’”<br />\n<b>Diamonds</b>\n“When I wrote ‘Diamonds’—in 2019 in London—I was in the studio and I was pretending to be a really rich woman whose husband had left her and taken all her things. She’s just in this wedding dress in the middle of a huge mansion. Think Moira Rose of <i>Schitt’s Creek</i>. This wasn’t even going to be on the album, but I just kept returning to it in quarantine. The moment I knew this song was something was when I played it to my mum and she freaked out. I call it a sexy exorcism.”<br />\n<b>Another One</b>\n“My favorite song I’ve ever done. The day I wrote it in LA, I had that moment we’ve all been through: hearing through the grapevine that someone you've been with has met someone else. I was so sad. We were just dancing and drinking, and it was such a healing moment. We gave the song to Guy [Lawrence] from Disclosure, who made the ending really trance-y. It just captures the emotion that I was feeling that day perfectly.”<br />\n<b>My Oasis (feat. Burna Boy)</b>\n“I can’t believe Burna Boy said yes to this—I’m still in shock about it, to be honest. I wrote this song during lockdown and sent it to him, because I heard him on it immediately. It’s more about sex, finding someone that you're enjoying and finding sex during a dry period. When I wrote it, it was really organic. It was the lockdown mood I was in that day. Being single in lockdown? It's tough!”<br />\n<b>So Serious</b>\n“The lyrics in this song are some of the deepest on this album. It’s talking about my mental health and my depression. About how you think everything's okay and then suddenly you're crying in the street and asking yourself, ‘Why am I so serious? Why am I so dark? Why do I get so down?’ This song is saying, ‘I'm beating myself up. Is anyone else beating themselves up?’ Because what you need when you're sad is you need to know that other people are in it with you. I wrote this song thinking that one day me and my fans can all sing that together and sing about being miserable in a really playful way. It's a cute little pop song.”<br />\n<b>Dance (’Til You Love Someone Else)</b>\n“This is like ‘Dancing With a Stranger’ part two. If on ‘Dancing With a Stranger’ I'm sexy, heartbroken, and dancing with a stranger feeling sad, on this one I'm going out and I need to find someone to heal that feeling. I need to mask the heartbreak immediately with someone else. It's more aggressive, darker, and more desperate. There’s angst to this song and it’s a bit more hedonistic.”<br />\n<b>For the Lover That I Lost</b>\n“This could be musical theater, to be quite honest. But I thought after ‘Dance (’Til You Love Someone Else),’ which is so dramatic, I wanted to shift the album. It would still be dramatic, but in a ballad way. [Norwegian LA-based production team] Stargate and I wrote this, and we gave it to Céline Dion, who had it on her 2019 album <i>Courage</i>. But just to try it, I went into the studio and sang it again. It’s like it's not even my song and more like I’m covering Céline's song. But it’s my ode to her, because she has been a huge part of the last few years for me. The day I went through my breakup, I went for a long walk in a forest and I just went into the middle of it, where no one could see me, and listened to ‘It's All Coming Back to Me Now.’ I just cried my eyes out. So I had to have a nod to Céline on this album.”<br />\n<b>Breaking Hearts</b>\n“This is a light song and a really sad song. We wrote it slow and then it became bouncier. But I didn't want this to reach the stars. I didn't want it to go anywhere. It’s me being a bitch and saying, ‘Fuck you.’ It’s going through an angry moment of heartbreak.”<br />\n<b>Forgive Myself</b>\n“It doesn't get sadder on the record than this song. This was the freshest one after my breakup. Two people can't collide into one, they have to grow alongside each other. ‘Forgive Myself’ was the beginning of me understanding that and saying, ‘Okay, for me to feel better, I'm going to have to forgive myself for all the things I’ve done in that relationship, and for all the things that I've ever done in relationships that were bad. And I need to work on myself to feel better.’”<br />\n<b>Love Goes (feat. Labrinth)</b>\n“When Labrinth and I were talking about this song, it was about the journey of love and the journey of heartbreak. In my head—and he probably won’t be happy with me saying this—Labrinth is the boyfriend or the ex. He’s saying, ‘Look, we both know you're fucked up. That's why this is isn't working.’ And I’m replying, ‘No, <i>you're</i> fucked up. <i>That's</i> why this isn't working.’ The ending is big, and when the beat comes in, you can dance to it. It's almost like coming home to yourself. If there was one musical snippet that I could take to describe the last three years, it would just be that piece of music at the end. Because I felt free.”<br />\n<b>Kids Again</b>\n“This song is completely different to everything else on the album. ‘Kids Again’ is the moment when you sit and look back at everything. I made the record and I was ready to move on to album four, and was doing just that. But it's also my piece to the relationship. It's saying, ‘I still miss you sometimes, but we were kids.’ And it's the other side of ‘Young.’ It was like a bookend for me. This song is also starting to lean into a more stripped-back, soulful musicality that I want to get into on the next record. I want to step away a little bit from electronic music and get back to some rootsy queer soul. I like to keep people on their toes.”<br />\n<b>Dancing With a Stranger (with Normani)</b>\n“I wrote this on tour and was just playing around. I was genuinely dancing with strangers, and I wrote about this one guy I met who was just such a lovely man. It was the first time after ‘Promises’ that I got into the studio and thought, ‘I can write some pop songs now and have a little bit of fun with this.’ Vocally, too, it was so nice just singing with ease and not belting. The Normani featuring happened so beautifully. The day I wrote this song, she was downstairs having a meeting. I was like, ‘She would smash this.’ So she came upstairs and listened to it and she cut it there and then. It was really special. I had no idea it would do what it's done. It's been one of my biggest-ever songs.”<br />\n<b>How Do You Sleep?</b>\n“We wanted to nod towards George Michael in a 2019 way (because it was 2019 when we wrote it). And it was just so fun. But I remember the day after I wrote this, I played it to my sister and she hated it! It put me off it a little bit. And then I lived with it for a bit and then we all just started to fall in love with it.”<br />\n<b>To Die For</b>\n“There’s a street in LA called Abbot Kinney, which is very bougie. I got lavender ice cream there one Sunday and was walking around. Everyone around me was so happy, but I was not feeling good. Sometimes, you just get fed up with being single. It's such a nice feeling to be in love and to go through life having a partner by your side. And I thought that we captured that in a song. I will always love this one.”<br />\n<b>I'm Ready (with Demi Lovato)</b>\n“This song is nuts. I don't even know what it is, and I'm not sure if I love it or I hate it. Either way, it’s an ode to a trashy queer club. I grew up in the countryside and then came to London. The only places I could go to be around people who were like-minded were these really awful gay bars. They play awful music. It's loud, it's intense. Your feet are sticking to the floor. There's loads of confused people there. Sometimes angry people, sometimes highly sexual people. Lots of drugs. I started to have this real connection to the pop songs that would play in these places, which I find beautiful now. A lot of my peers and people around me would say that music is awful. But I find it uplifting. I feel like I captured that in some way in ‘I’m Ready.’ I wanted to almost make a song that would make people squirm a bit.”<br />\n<b>Fire on Fire</b>\n“This song was written for [the 2018 BBC adaptation of] <i>Watership Down</i>. And I wrote it when I was very much in love. It's probably one of the only love songs I've written. But it's very dramatic. Again, I think I was trying to be Céline Dion. It was about intense passion—about two people who are fire and trying to make it work, which is a dangerous game. It was so fun to make, stepping into that musical theater side which is always going to be in me. One day I want to be in a dress in the Royal Albert Hall singing it with a huge orchestra.”<br />\n<b>Promises</b>\n“I was called a crooner for the first six years of my career. But then, after <i>The Thrill of It All</i>, I got in the studio with Calvin Harris and Jessie Reyez. Jessie poured us both a glass of whiskey and we just started dancing around. Normally it would be like, ‘Sit down, let's write a song. Let's get into it.’ But this was like, ‘I don't have to take myself that seriously in the studio. This can be a fun space.’ So it was the catalyst to how I wrote this record, which was ‘Let's go in the studio and let's have a laugh. Let's shoot for the stars. The rule book's out the window now. Let's just enjoy ourselves.’”",

I'm still the person who was writing those sad love songs.’”<br />\n<b>Diamonds</b>\n“When I wrote ‘Diamonds’—in 2019 in London—I was in the studio and I was pretending to be a really rich woman whose husband had left her and taken all her things. She’s just in this wedding dress in the middle of a huge mansion. Think Moira Rose of <i>Schitt’s Creek</i>. This wasn’t even going to be on the album, but I just kept returning to it in quarantine. The moment I knew this song was something was when I played it to my mum and she freaked out. I call it a sexy exorcism.”<br />\n<b>Another One</b>\n“My favorite song I’ve ever done. The day I wrote it in LA, I had that moment we’ve all been through: hearing through the grapevine that someone you've been with has met someone else. I was so sad. We were just dancing and drinking, and it was such a healing moment. We gave the song to Guy [Lawrence] from Disclosure, who made the ending really trance-y. It just captures the emotion that I was feeling that day perfectly.”<br />\n<b>My Oasis (feat. Burna Boy)</b>\n“I can’t believe Burna Boy said yes to this—I’m still in shock about it, to be honest. I wrote this song during lockdown and sent it to him, because I heard him on it immediately. It’s more about sex, finding someone that you're enjoying and finding sex during a dry period. When I wrote it, it was really organic. It was the lockdown mood I was in that day. Being single in lockdown? It's tough!”<br />\n<b>So Serious</b>\n“The lyrics in this song are some of the deepest on this album. It’s talking about my mental health and my depression. About how you think everything's okay and then suddenly you're crying in the street and asking yourself, ‘Why am I so serious? Why am I so dark? Why do I get so down?’ This song is saying, ‘I'm beating myself up. Is anyone else beating themselves up?’ Because what you need when you're sad is you need to know that other people are in it with you. I wrote this song thinking that one day me and my fans can all sing that together and sing about being miserable in a really playful way. It's a cute little pop song.”<br />\n<b>Dance (’Til You Love Someone Else)</b>\n“This is like ‘Dancing With a Stranger’ part two. If on ‘Dancing With a Stranger’ I'm sexy, heartbroken, and dancing with a stranger feeling sad, on this one I'm going out and I need to find someone to heal that feeling. I need to mask the heartbreak immediately with someone else. It's more aggressive, darker, and more desperate. There’s angst to this song and it’s a bit more hedonistic.”<br />\n<b>For the Lover That I Lost</b>\n“This could be musical theater, to be quite honest. But I thought after ‘Dance (’Til You Love Someone Else),’ which is so dramatic, I wanted to shift the album. It would still be dramatic, but in a ballad way. [Norwegian LA-based production team] Stargate and I wrote this, and we gave it to Céline Dion, who had it on her 2019 album <i>Courage</i>. But just to try it, I went into the studio and sang it again. It’s like it's not even my song and more like I’m covering Céline's song. But it’s my ode to her, because she has been a huge part of the last few years for me. The day I went through my breakup, I went for a long walk in a forest and I just went into the middle of it, where no one could see me, and listened to ‘It's All Coming Back to Me Now.’ I just cried my eyes out. So I had to have a nod to Céline on this album.”<br />\n<b>Breaking Hearts</b>\n“This is a light song and a really sad song. We wrote it slow and then it became bouncier. But I didn't want this to reach the stars. I didn't want it to go anywhere. It’s me being a b***h and saying, ‘F**k you.’ It’s going through an angry moment of heartbreak.”<br />\n<b>Forgive Myself</b>\n“It doesn't get sadder on the record than this song. This was the freshest one after my breakup. Two people can't collide into one, they have to grow alongside each other. ‘Forgive Myself’ was the beginning of me understanding that and saying, ‘Okay, for me to feel better, I'm going to have to forgive myself for all the things I’ve done in that relationship, and for all the things that I've ever done in relationships that were bad. And I need to work on myself to feel better.’”<br />\n<b>Love Goes (feat. Labrinth)</b>\n“When Labrinth and I were talking about this song, it was about the journey of love and the journey of heartbreak. In my head—and he probably won’t be happy with me saying this—Labrinth is the boyfriend or the ex. He’s saying, ‘Look, we both know you're f**ked up. That's why this is isn't working.’ And I’m replying, ‘No, <i>you're</i> f**ked up. <i>That's</i> why this isn't working.’ The ending is big, and when the beat comes in, you can dance to it. It's almost like coming home to yourself. If there was one musical snippet that I could take to describe the last three years, it would just be that piece of music at the end. Because I felt free.”<br />\n<b>Kids Again</b>\n“This song is completely different to everything else on the album. ‘Kids Again’ is the moment when you sit and look back at everything. I made the record and I was ready to move on to album four, and was doing just that. But it's also my piece to the relationship. It's saying, ‘I still miss you sometimes, but we were kids.’ And it's the other side of ‘Young.’ It was like a bookend for me. This song is also starting to lean into a more stripped-back, soulful musicality that I want to get into on the next record. I want to step away a little bit from electronic music and get back to some rootsy queer soul. I like to keep people on their toes.”<br />\n<b>Dancing With a Stranger (with Normani)</b>\n“I wrote this on tour and was just playing around. I was genuinely dancing with strangers, and I wrote about this one guy I met who was just such a lovely man. It was the first time after ‘Promises’ that I got into the studio and thought, ‘I can write some pop songs now and have a little bit of fun with this.’ Vocally, too, it was so nice just singing with ease and not belting. The Normani featuring happened so beautifully. The day I wrote this song, she was downstairs having a meeting. I was like, ‘She would smash this.’ So she came upstairs and listened to it and she cut it there and then. It was really special. I had no idea it would do what it's done. It's been one of my biggest-ever songs.”<br />\n<b>How Do You Sleep?</b>\n“We wanted to nod towards George Michael in a 2019 way (because it was 2019 when we wrote it). And it was just so fun. But I remember the day after I wrote this, I played it to my sister and she hated it! It put me off it a little bit. And then I lived with it for a bit and then we all just started to fall in love with it.”<br />\n<b>To Die For</b>\n“There’s a street in LA called Abbot Kinney, which is very bougie. I got lavender ice cream there one Sunday and was walking around. Everyone around me was so happy, but I was not feeling good. Sometimes, you just get fed up with being single. It's such a nice feeling to be in love and to go through life having a partner by your side. And I thought that we captured that in a song. I will always love this one.”<br />\n<b>I'm Ready (with Demi Lovato)</b>\n“This song is nuts. I don't even know what it is, and I'm not sure if I love it or I hate it. Either way, it’s an ode to a trashy queer club. I grew up in the countryside and then came to London. The only places I could go to be around people who were like-minded were these really awful gay bars. They play awful music. It's loud, it's intense. Your feet are sticking to the floor. There's loads of confused people there. Sometimes angry people, sometimes highly sexual people. Lots of drugs. I started to have this real connection to the pop songs that would play in these places, which I find beautiful now. A lot of my peers and people around me would say that music is awful. But I find it uplifting. I feel like I captured that in some way in ‘I’m Ready.’ I wanted to almost make a song that would make people squirm a bit.”<br />\n<b>Fire on Fire</b>\n“This song was written for [the 2018 BBC adaptation of] <i>Watership Down</i>. And I wrote it when I was very much in love. It's probably one of the only love songs I've written. But it's very dramatic. Again, I think I was trying to be Céline Dion. It was about intense passion—about two people who are fire and trying to make it work, which is a dangerous game. It was so fun to make, stepping into that musical theater side which is always going to be in me. One day I want to be in a dress in the Royal Albert Hall singing it with a huge orchestra.”<br />\n<b>Promises</b>\n“I was called a crooner for the first six years of my career. But then, after <i>The Thrill of It All</i>, I got in the studio with Calvin Harris and Jessie Reyez. Jessie poured us both a glass of whiskey and we just started dancing around. Normally it would be like, ‘Sit down, let's write a song. Let's get into it.’ But this was like, ‘I don't have to take myself that seriously in the studio. This can be a fun space.’ So it was the catalyst to how I wrote this record, which was ‘Let's go in the studio and let's have a laugh. Let's shoot for the stars. The rule book's out the window now. Let's just enjoy ourselves.’”",

                "Sam Smith’s fourth album, <i>Gloria</i>, opens with the kind of music we’ve come to expect from the British singer-songwriter: “Love Me More” is a gospel-inflected ballad celebrating the power of self-acceptance. But after that, Smith goes off script. “I wanted it to be a patchwork of pop, it’s something that I was really passionate about,” they tell Apple Music. “I want to be flipping from genre to genre to genre to genre.” <i>Gloria</i>, then, brings us sensual R&B, dazzling dance floor moments (“Lose You” is perhaps Smith’s best sad banger yet), twisting hyperpop, a dancehall-indebted earworm, and even choral music, with embraces of sex, the power of community, and queer joy and history along the way. “My aim with this record was to make sure there is not one song on this album that I don't like,” adds Smith. “I've put so much into this record in terms of the production and the time. I became obsessed. I lived inside the music. I've never worked that hard before.”\n\nThere’s a confidence present that most artists reach a few albums deep, but it’s more than just the gains of experience you can hear here. Made between Suffolk, LA, and Jamaica, <i>Gloria</i> is an album of rebellion, liberation, and letting go of the past, as one of modern pop’s biggest voices unveils their most assured music—and self—yet. “I don’t want to sound cheesy, but <i>Gloria</i> for me is like when a butterfly leaves a cocoon,” says Smith. “That’s what I wanted this record to feel like all the way through. I wanted there to be strength within every single song. I feel like my true artist self has arrived in a way.” Read on as Smith delves deep into every track on <i>Gloria</i>.\n\n<b>“Love Me More”</b>\n“I knew I wanted to write a song that said how I was feeling. I find the whole self-love thing quite cringey. Self-love sometimes feels like a destination; with self-acceptance, every day I have to try and accept myself and show myself love. That's what I was trying to put across in this song. I started this album like my old music. ‘Love Me More’ is the last opportunity I was giving my older fans to come into this next stage with me. This is a song written for my fans, and every song after it is written for me.”\n\n<b>“No God”</b>\n“This comes from a personal story about someone in my life who I’ve lost to drastic opinions. But as me, [songwriters and producers] Jimmy [Napes] and Stargate were writing it, it became a rhetoric on a certain type of person with a god complex. It’s about the ignoring of a human being and allowing someone’s drastic politics to get in the way of caring for someone else. The magic of this song came from the production: the live playing, the backing vocals. We just picked away at it until it sounded perfect. To me, it sounds super expensive.”\n\n<b>“Hurting Interlude”</b>\n“I found this amazing piece: a news anchor speaking at the first-ever Gay Pride in New York. What he says in this interlude broke my heart and took me back to ‘Lose You,’ a song written about a lesbian friend who had her first queer relationship with a woman. Someone's first heartbreak as a queer person can be very intense because of what we do go through when it comes to love. I felt like it was the perfect quote before ‘Lose You.’”\n\n<b>“Lose You”</b>\n“As a queer community, we love our sad dance songs. With this album, you could dedicate every song to a pop diva of mine. ‘Love Me More’ would be Whitney, ‘No God’ would be Brandy, and ‘Lose You’ would be Robyn or George Michael. I wrote this song with some of the most amazing pop writers and it felt like a mastering of a beautifully formed pop song. The production wasn’t taking me to Berlin, though, and I needed it to take me to a German gay club. The little things we did towards the end of this song really took it there—it gives me this really Euro, unashamed, gay, chic feel. It's drama, drama, drama.”\n\n<b>“Perfect” (feat. Jessie Reyez)</b>\n“This is where sex starts to come into the record. I feel like I’ve been a bit desexualized during my career, and I was very young when I started. Being 20 years old and moving onstage in the way I would in a gay bar was petrifying. Jessie really taught me to be brave: I would say things to her in the studio and she wouldn’t laugh or feel uncomfortable. The whole concept of the song is saying, ‘I’m a hot mess,’ and feeling yourself in a really imperfect way. This song is the Rihanna moment—we worked with Stargate on it, who worked on <i>Rated R</i>, one of my favorite Rihanna records. Stargate got hold of Nuno Bettencourt, who does guitar solos on <i>Rated R</i>, and he just ripped all over the song—I love it so much.”\n\n<b>“Unholy” [with Kim Petras]</b>\n“We were in Jamaica and [producer] Omer Fedi was fucking around on the guitar and playing this scale, which I started singing to. Everyone in the room was really confused; they didn’t know if they liked it or not. I had someone on my mind who was pissing me off and I just had to get it out. After we got back, everyone liked the song but said, ‘This is not on brand.’ But it kept prodding at me. I said everything I needed to in the first verse, and that’s when Kim came into the picture. There were about eight guys in the studio who were trying to push Kim’s verse in one direction. We spent all day doing it that way, but then something in my gut said, ‘This is shit.’ There’s a certain humor that only a queer person can understand because we’ve been through it and we live it. And that’s what the verse needed. We needed to tease the man, we needed to make him a ‘Balenciaga daddy.’ This is the most powerful part of the album and it's the most powerful piece of music I've ever been a part of. It’s like an exorcism.”\n\n<b>“How to Cry”</b>\n“This is about the same person ‘Unholy’ is about. I wanted that breath, but I also only wanted one of these moments, because this isn’t the record for super organic, stripped music. In ‘Unholy’ I’m laughing and taking the piss. But at the heart of that emotion is a very sad story. It’s also about a relationship I was in, and about how I think being an emotional person is such a strong characteristic. I really do believe it’s a superpower. So it’s a love letter to me.” \n\n<b>“Six Shots”</b>\n“It’s a paragraph change—after ‘How to Cry,’ this is the pre-drinks to a night. But they’re intense pre-drinks, because we start having sex. This is the first proper sex song I wrote—I just felt really freed by it. At the time, I was insanely single and that’s where the lyric ‘There’s no loving me’ comes from. I was so single that I was almost taken. I wasn’t open to love.”\n\n<b>“Gimme” (feat. Koffee and Jessie Reyez)</b>\n“I’m obsessed with this song—it’s possibly my favorite on the album. It’s the most sexually intense lyrics I’ve ever written, and the verse lyric is actually filthy! The song is basically about wanting the dick so much you can cry. I love dancehall music and have tried many times to write songs that have a dancehall feel. I needed to be in Jamaica to do it in a way where it felt authentic, and I’m so proud that ‘Gimme’ did that. Like a lot of the record, this song is about sharing the moment—I didn’t want to be in the song too much.”\n\n<b>“Dorothy’s Interlude”</b>\n“The opening quote is Divine, which is just pure sass and fabulousness. Next is Judy Garland—there are so many queer connotations with Judy, namely the famous myth that when she died, everyone congregated in New York at Stonewall and the riots started the same night. Then after that you’ve got Sylvia Rivera. It’s quite a harrowing speech at Gay Pride in New York, talking about all of the awful things that are happening in the homeless hospitals to trans people, and her own community of gay men were booing her onstage. After that it goes into RuPaul saying one of the most incredible sayings we have out there. This interlude goes through the ages.” \n\n<b>“I’m Not Here to Make Friends”</b>\n“This song was made with Calvin Harris, Stargate, me, and Jessie Reyez. It was a joy to make. I went on a date the night before and I was just so sick of going on dates where people treated me like a friend or just wanted to meet me because I’m Sam Smith. Even though the song has nothing to do with it, the song title is also an attitude and spirit on the record that I have: I’m done trying to please people now.”\n\n<b>“Gloria”</b>\n“The sound of this song is one of the most beautiful sounds I've ever created. And the reason I think it’s one of my favorite songs is that I’m not on it. [Producer] David Odlum helped convince me to actually sing on this song. At the beginning of my career, I remember everyone telling me I was a good singer, but no one ever really gave me credit for my songwriting. And what I love about this song is it's not about me, it's about something I wrote. This song is about opening your arms to the sky and singing your song as loud as you can. And I really think that my younger self needed it. I went with this idea of, I want this to be an album for a younger me that will give me joy and hope. The lyric is incredibly deep, but it's also playable like a lullaby.”\n\n<b>“Who We Love” [with Ed Sheeran]</b>\n“Ed sent me this song, and I was fearful to begin with because I don’t usually take songs and make them mine. Ed and I have been friends for a long time. I’m not interested in doing an Ed collab that sounds like a hit—I wanted it to mean something. And when I heard this, I felt truly touched. I felt like it was a queer ballad anthem written from a friend. There was something so poignant and beautiful about it. Ed has personally guided me through tough times and been a friend in a very cold industry. I wanted everything about this song to feel warm.”",

It takes a village of talent to put on my shows, and it’s important for me now to showcase and celebrate the artists around me.” In <i>Live From The Royal Albert Hall</i>, which arrives to Apple Music listeners as part of the From Apple Music With Love series, Smith celebrates their body of work with a curated selection of songs from the evening.\n\nThough Smith was mostly performing songs from their catalog, the singer says the set was imbued with the spirit of their fourth studio album <i>Gloria</i>, scheduled to release in January 2023. “With this show it was about adding a little <i>Gloria</i> to all my songs,” Smith says. “I always want to change all the songs a little to fit the mood and the tones of whatever project I’m currently releasing. But I am also passionate about playing the songs the way people love them.” One listen to <i>Live From The Royal Albert Hall</i> and you’re sure to have found that Smith couldn’t lose either way.",

And the reason I think it’s one of my favorite songs is that I’m not on it. [Producer] David Odlum helped convince me to actually sing on this song. At the beginning of my career, I remember everyone telling me I was a good singer, but no one ever really gave me credit for my songwriting. And what I love about this song is it's not about me, it's about something I wrote. This song is about opening your arms to the sky and singing your song as loud as you can. And I really think that my younger self needed it. I went with this idea of, I want this to be an album for a younger me that will give me joy and hope. The lyric is incredibly deep, but it's also playable like a lullaby.”\n\n<b>“Who We Love” [with Ed Sheeran]</b>\n“Ed sent me this song, and I was fearful to begin with because I don’t usually take songs and make them mine. Ed and I have been friends for a long time. I’m not interested in doing an Ed collab that sounds like a hit—I wanted it to mean something. And when I heard this, I felt truly touched. I felt like it was a queer ballad anthem written from a friend. There was something so poignant and beautiful about it. Ed has personally guided me through tough times and been a friend in a very cold industry. I wanted everything about this song to feel warm.”\n\n<b>Apple Music Edition tracks</b>\n“It was honestly one of the performances of my life. First of all, the venue was incredible, but I really wanted to change the way I did things live with that performance. I wanted to have bodies on the stage. I wanted to introduce dance. I basically start the show like I start my career, and the first song is ‘Stay With Me.’ Even in terms of the clothes, I start in all black, and then the show slowly transitions into <i>Gloria</i> and ‘Unholy.’ I take you from heaven to hell, because hell is just fabulous! I never thought that I'd be able to get the whole of the Royal Albert Hall slut-dropping and dancing. It was crazy. Cat Burns was there on the night, which was so special. Kim came out. It was really about sharing the limelight and sharing this time with other musicians.”",
